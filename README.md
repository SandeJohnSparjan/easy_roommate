Easy Roommate Website
The purpose of this system is to make hostel life/room life easy. The system allows the roommates to split the bills, transactions, remind the payer to payback the bills. 

Since there will be a lot of bills that will be shared among the roommates, it will be a problem when it comes to paying bills and keeping a tab on expenses. Our focus will be to create an application which will reduce the stress of calculations by keeping a track of who owes to whom. This system lets you and your friends to add, update and delete various bills and helps you to settle-up with each other after the payment is done. The system allows the users to create groups and split an expense among the individuals who are involved in the bill.
